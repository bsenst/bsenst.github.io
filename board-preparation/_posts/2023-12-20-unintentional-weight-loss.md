# How is weight loss defined for B symptoms?

"B symptoms" typically refer to systemic symptoms associated with lymphomas, especially Hodgkin's lymphoma. These symptoms are not related to weight loss specifically but include:

* **Fever**: Persistent, unexplained fever without signs of infection.
* **Night Sweats**: Profuse sweating during the night that may drench the patient's sleepwear and sheets.
* **Unintentional Weight Loss**: Unexplained weight loss exceeding 10% of the body weight over the preceding 6 months.

The unintentional weight loss mentioned as one of the B symptoms is not specific to lymphomas alone

# Cachectic vs. normal weight?

*Cachectic*:

* **Definition**: Cachexia is a complex syndrome characterized by severe weight loss, muscle wasting, weakness, and a general decline in physical and mental health. It is often associated with chronic illnesses such as cancer, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other advanced-stage diseases.
* **Appearance**: Individuals with cachexia may appear emaciated, with noticeable loss of muscle mass and subcutaneous fat.
* **Causes**: Cachexia is typically the result of a combination of factors, including increased energy expenditure, reduced food intake, and metabolic changes associated with chronic diseases.

*Normal Weight*:

* **Definition**: Normal weight refers to a body weight that falls within a healthy range relative to height, as assessed by tools such as Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a common measure that takes into account both weight and height to categorize individuals into different weight categories.
* **Appearance**: Individuals with a normal weight for their height are generally within a healthy range of body fat and muscle mass.
* **Health Implications**: Maintaining a normal weight is associated with a lower risk of various health conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and certain musculoskeletal issues.

# What is the diagnosis that comes to mind first for a 50-year-old woman with weight gain and feeling cold?

One common medical condition that may come to mind is hypothyroidism. Key symptoms of hypothyroidism include:

* **Weight Gain**: Individuals with hypothyroidism may experience unexplained weight gain, often despite no significant changes in diet or physical activity.
* **Feeling Cold**: Hypothyroidism can cause a decrease in metabolic rate, leading to a sensation of feeling cold, even in normal or warm temperatures.
* **Fatigue**: Individuals with hypothyroidism may feel tired, lethargic, and have a general sense of fatigue.
* **Dry Skin and Hair**: Hypothyroidism can result in dry skin and brittle hair.
* **Constipation**: Slowed metabolism can affect the digestive system, leading to constipation.
* **Muscle Aches and Weakness**: Some people with hypothyroidism may experience muscle aches and weakness.

Other potential causes of weight gain and feeling cold in a middle-aged woman could include hormonal changes related to menopause, insulin resistance, or other metabolic and endocrine conditions.
